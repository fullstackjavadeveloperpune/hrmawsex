Deploy Spring Boot MySQL Application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with Amazon RDS

Spring Boot: It is an open-source, Java-based framework that provides support for Rapid Application Development and gives a platform for developing stand-alone and production-ready applications within minutes.
It has extra support of auto-configuration and embedded server like Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow.

AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): It provides scalable virtual servers (instances) to run applications. It gives full control over the operating system and resources, allowing customization, direct server management, and hosting applications in the cloud.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk: It is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for deploying and managing applications. It handles infrastructure provisioning, scaling, and monitoring while you focus on writing code. You simply upload your application, and it automates deployment and operations.

AWS RDS (Relational Database Service): It is a managed service that simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of relational databases in the cloud. It supports popular database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, and Amazon's own Aurora. Key features include:

Fully Managed: Automates tasks like provisioning, patching, backups, and maintenance.
High Availability: Offers Multi-AZ deployments for fault tolerance and automatic failover.
Scalability: Easily scale compute and storage with minimal downtime.
Security: Built-in encryption, VPC integration, and IAM access controls.
Backup and Recovery: Automatic backups, manual snapshots, and point-in-time recovery.

RDS reduces operational overhead, allowing developers to focus on building applications instead of managing infrastructure.
